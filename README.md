## 🎯 Purpose

This tool assists Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) and Ethics Committees in identifying and addressing AI-specific risks in human subjects research. It complements standard IRB review processes by providing structured guidance on risks unique to artificial intelligence and machine learning systems.

**Key Features:**
- ✅ Structured around the **3-Phase AI HSR IRB Review Framework**
- ✅ Evidence-based: Built on MIT AI Risk Repository, ISO 14971, and U.S. regulatory frameworks
- ✅ Practical guidance with reviewer prompts and mitigation strategies
- ✅ Validated at 23+ institutions with 21% improvement in reviewer confidence
- ✅ Interactive filtering by development phase, risk domain, and specific risk type
